With the specific data from:
 https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip  
 
The Analysis contains the following files:
 - Week4Assignment_Codebook.md
 - run_analysis.R
 - tidydata.txt

The analysisis performed via the script named "run_analysis.R" does the following. 

- Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
- Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
- Renames the activity to there appropriate names.
- Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
- Creates a second independent tidy data set ("tidydata.txt") with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
